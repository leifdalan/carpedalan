        Welcome to our family! <em>What is this website?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Vega was born, Leif and I had some tough talks about her and our
        future privacy. Faced with several online options, we decided to curate
        a private photo collection that we had complete control over instead of
        broadcasting our family across email and social media to reach our
        people. This website represents our humble attempt to preserve our
        family&#39;s privacy while still sharing our special moments with people
        we love and trust.

      </StyledTitle>
      <p>
        Clicking the download button on an image will save a full resolution
        copy of that image to your device. If you want to print physical copies
        of images, we highly recommend using{' '}
        <a href="https://www.mpix.com/products/prints">MPIX</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This service is popular with professional photographers for everything
        from school portraits to wedding photography. In our experience, print
        services with quick turnarounds such as Walgreens, Costco and Shutterfly
        produce significantly lower quality images regardless of the resolution
        of the digital file.
